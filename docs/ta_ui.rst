=============
Using the Teacher Interface
=============

The teacher interface provides the instructional staff with an overview of
students' performance on Webwork assignments, allows creating and sending inline
hints to a student's Webwork page, and facilitates finding common issues and
sending hints automatically to students based on programmatically defined
criteria.

===========
Navigating the Interface
===========

The TA interface can be accessed at http://webwork.cse.ucsd.edu/teacher/ng/ (the
old, hint-only interface is at http://webwork.cse.ucsd.edu/teacher/ ). Log in
using your Webwork credentials to access the interface (you must have some form
of access level above student to see the interface). You can choose a different
course from the dropdown menu in the top left. After logging in you are
presented with a list of assignments that are in the Webwork course, along with
some statistics about how students did on those assignments. The columns of the
table are sortable.
